# Changelog

All notable changes to the RND Warehouse Management app will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [2.2.0] - 2026-10-20

### Changed
- 2.2.0 — Work Order workflow `Work Order Scheduling` replaces `Starting Work Order`: Draft → Schedule (Planeacion) → Scheduled (docstatus 1) → Cancel (Planeacion, Manufacturing Manager) → Cancelled; Don't Override Status; new fixtures Workflow State / Workflow Action Master / Role Planeacion; `before_insert` resets `workflow_state` on amended Work Orders and Stock Entries; `after_migrate` maps existing Work Orders' states by docstatus, closes stale Open Workflow Actions (status Completed — Workflow Action allows only Open / Completed), deletes the old workflow. Requires `bench migrate` on each site.
- Planeacion is granted in addition to Manufacturing User; it gates Schedule and Cancel and widens the Work Order list (every Work Order), it grants no document permission by itself.
- Rule: Workflows on Work Order and Stock Entry are edited in the repo only; a UI edit on a site is wiped at the next migrate.

## [2.1.1] - 2026-10-18

### Fixed
- 2.1.1 — hourly `update_zone_status` no longer re-saves Work Orders; writes the five zone fields with `db.set_value(update_modified=False)` only when they change; no Version, no notifications, no required_items re-derivation; manual endpoint uses the same path.
